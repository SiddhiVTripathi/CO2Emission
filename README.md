# CO2Emission
The python file "CO2Emission.py" is basic code based on machine learning, in which we can predict with help of previous data available without explicitly programing the code for it.
For this python file to run on a system the requirements for the system are:
1. Latest python(python 3.7 recommended)
2. Numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, scikitlearn are the libraries that should be installed.
Thanks to IBM and coursera.com for helping me in this project.
Also a great thanks to Jupyterlab.
